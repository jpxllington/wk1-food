              <h5 class="card-title text-center">The Refuge - Manchester</h5>
              <p class="card-text text-center">A large venue that is absolutely packed on a Saturday night with partygoers, but which on Sunday retreats to an oasis of calm.

                Their roasts are make for sharing with large platters being served with ample food and lashings of gravy. Their Yorkshire puddings are often so big that you could nearly crawl inside them and have a nap. Some great cocktails and a super wine list round out the offering to perfection.</p>

              <p class="card-text text-center">With an idyllic village green setting in the small hamlet of Anick, this is the perfect place to base your Sunday day out around.

                Walk in the countryside before your Sunday lunch to work up an appetite. This is not a portion for the faint hearted or those on a diet! The veggies, roasties and the pudding are every bit as good as the meat and the whole meals just blends together into one perfect delightful treat.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title text-center">Harwood Arms - Fullham</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Harwood Arms head chef Sally Abé says it’s the attention to detail at every stage that makes the Sunday menu at this Michelin-starred pub so special. “We carefully source the best beef from Cumbria, we use the best [Agria] potatoes for the crispiest roasties, really flavoursome carrots and a rich red wine gravy. The portions are generous and served sharing-style for everyone to dig in, and the relaxed dining room makes guests feel at home, which adds to the enjoyment of it all.”

                Unusual cuts can also turn up on the Sunday menu at the Harwood Arms so expect to see the likes of braised jowl of Tamworth pork with crushed turnip, roast apple and mustard, alongside the more traditional roast sirloin of 45-day-aged Shorthorn beef with yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, cauliflower cheese croquettes, horseradish cream, root vegetables, bone marrow gravy and greens.</p>

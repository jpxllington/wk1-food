              <p class="card-text text-center">A large venue that is absolutely packed on a Saturday night with partygoers, but which on Sunday retreats to an oasis of calm.

                Their roasts are make for sharing with large platters being served with ample food and lashings of gravy. Their Yorkshire puddings are often so big that you could nearly crawl inside them and have a nap. Some great cocktails and a super wine list round out the offering to perfection.</p>

                Walk in the countryside before your Sunday lunch to work up an appetite. This is not a portion for the faint hearted or those on a diet! The veggies, roasties and the pudding are every bit as good as the meat and the whole meals just blends together into one perfect delightful treat.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Harwood Arms head chef Sally Abé says it’s the attention to detail at every stage that makes the Sunday menu at this Michelin-starred pub so special. “We carefully source the best beef from Cumbria, we use the best [Agria] potatoes for the crispiest roasties, really flavoursome carrots and a rich red wine gravy. The portions are generous and served sharing-style for everyone to dig in, and the relaxed dining room makes guests feel at home, which adds to the enjoyment of it all.”

                Unusual cuts can also turn up on the Sunday menu at the Harwood Arms so expect to see the likes of braised jowl of Tamworth pork with crushed turnip, roast apple and mustard, alongside the more traditional roast sirloin of 45-day-aged Shorthorn beef with yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, cauliflower cheese croquettes, horseradish cream, root vegetables, bone marrow gravy and greens.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title text-center">Origins of the roast dinner</h5>
              <p class="card-text text-center">The Sunday Roast originated in the British Isles as a meal to be eaten after church on Sunday. Eating a large meal following church services is common to most of Europe, but the Sunday Roast variant developed unique to the British Isles. On Sundays, all types of meat and dairy produce are allowed to be eaten; this is unlike Fridays, where many Roman Catholics and Anglicans traditionally abstain from eating meats, so ate fish instead. Likewise, it is traditional for Anglicans and English Catholics to fast before Sunday services, with a larger meal to break the fast afterwards. These religious rules created several traditional dishes in the United Kingdom. </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Only eating fish on Friday resulted in a British tradition of 'fish Fridays' which is still common in fish and chip shops and restaurants across the United Kingdom on Fridays, particularly during Lent.</li>
                  <li>To mark the end of not being able to eat meat the Sunday roast was created as a mark of celebration.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There are two historical points on the origins of the modern Sunday Roast. In the late 1700s, during the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom, families would place a cut of meat into the oven as they got ready for church. They would then add in vegetables such as potatoes, turnips and parsnips before going to church on a Sunday morning. When they returned from the church, the dinner was all but ready. The juices from the meat and vegetables were used to make a stock or gravy to pour on top of the dinner. The second opinion holds that the Sunday Roast dates back to medieval times, when the village serfs served the squire for six days a week. Then, on the Sunday, after the morning church service, serfs would assemble in a field and practise their battle techniques and were rewarded with a feast of oxen roasted on a spit.</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-center">Sunday Roasts can be served with a range of boiled, steamed and/or roasted vegetables. The vegetables served vary seasonally and regionally, but will usually include roast potatoes, roasted in meat dripping or vegetable oil, and also gravy made from juices released by the roasting meat, perhaps supplemented by one or more stock cubes, gravy browning/thickening, roux or corn flour. </p>
